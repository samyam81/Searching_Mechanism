# Searching Mechanism

## Introduction
This repository contains implementations of two common searching algorithms: Linear Search and Binary Search.

## Algorithms

### 1. Linear Search
Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a simple search algorithm that checks every element in a list or array until the desired element is found or the entire list has been traversed.

### 2. Binary Search
Binary search is a more efficient search algorithm, especially for sorted arrays. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the desired element, until it narrows down to the target element.

## Usage
To use any of the implementations, follow the general steps:

1. Navigate to the directory containing the desired implementation.
2. Compile the code (if necessary).
3. Run the compiled executable or bytecode.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions (if any) to provide input and observe the output.
